	renderers.

            <filter> (configures possible filters to restrict search to specific content or file types)
                <name /> (name of filter, this maps to a JS file located at
                            /webapps/studio/default-site/static-assets/components/cstudio-search/filters/{name}.js)
                <label />
                <default /> (true/false if this is the default filter)
            </filter>
        </filters>

                <type /> (Studio content type)
                <name /> (name of preview template, this maps to a JS file located at
                        /webapps/studio/default-site/static-assets/components/cstudio-search/results/{name}.js)
